# WinSize3
My version of WinSize2, a tool which position windows to a previously stored size and/or position depending on the screen resolution
Just store it anywhere on your PC and make a link to your autostart menu folder
Use hot key Ctrl+Alt+Z to store the position of the active window.
If this window is opened again, it`s position will be restored.
For each screen resolution, you can store your own positions
